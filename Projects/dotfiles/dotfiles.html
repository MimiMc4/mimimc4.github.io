                    If you check the last entry's date you can see that this has been a pretty busy semester at uni (and 
                    it still is, I should be studying right now...), so this will be a short one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few weeks back I was procrastinating working on some shitty app we have to make for one class,
                    so instead of working I just installed arch linux on my main pc. 
                    I've been using arch on my laptop
                    for a while now, but I still had windows on my desktop (ltsc tho). In theory I was going to wait 
                    until winter break for the change, but I just couldn't wait, so I just installed it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As always I had to redo the instalation twice because I always mess up setting up grub, but the installation is 
                    very straightforward, you just follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide">wiki instructions</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using arch is great and it has some comfy tools (ily pacman), but setting up everything is kinda rough,
                    especially when you have already spent time configuring many things to your liking once, so I wanted some good
                    way to share my config files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the internet I had already seen some people hosting their own config files on GitHub, but I was 
                    a bit unsure on how to link files on a git repository to my .config directory. Looking around I found
                    that there is already a tool made for this exact problem: "stow".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/stow">Stow</a> is a tool that manages symlinks between directories. You can use it to 
                    link directories on your git repository to your .config directory. Setting everything up is easy, just search a guide 
                    on google.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've created my dotfiles repo, with this structure:
                </p>
                <center> <!-- didnt know this tag existed lol, pretty useful--> 
                    <img style="margin-top: 10px;" src="tree.png" width="60%">
                </center>
                <p>
                    You can see that I can have my config files in there which is great. Now if I make any change on the repo, I can just 
                    pull from my other computer and have everything ready to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I'll use i3 on my desktop computer though (I'm using cinnamon for now), but is good to know that I can just switch
                    and have everything configured just like my laptop. (There were some compatibility issues with some applets, but everything 
                    should be ok now...). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main reason to make this was neovim. Setting up the package manager and the plugins was a pain, 
                    so I didn't want to start from scratch. Now I have everything exactly as I have it on my laptop (and some more, I finally installed 
                    an lsp).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linking alacritty and my bashrc files wasn't as necessary, but now I can easily use sus instead of sudo on all my computers 
                    from now on, so it's a win.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As always, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/MimiMc4/dotfiles">GitHub repo</a> if you want to checkout my config
                    files. Probably they won't be useful for anybody else though.
