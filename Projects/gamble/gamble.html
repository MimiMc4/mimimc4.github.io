                    A few days ago I was with one of my friends from uni working on a 
                    project together. The project is from a subject we both don't really
                    like, so we have a few strategies to keep ourselves motivated, and one
                    of them is to work on something fun before and after working on the 
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We've been experimenting with different ways of manipulating the output of a program
                   on the terminal, trying to change the color of the text and changing the position of the 
                   cursor. We were screwing around when my friend had the idea of using what we've been
                   learning to make a gambling command that spawns a slot machine on your teminal. The "let's 
                   go gambling meme" has been living rent free on our minds and I instantly loved the idea so 
                   we got straight to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we started coding, we had to first decide what symbols we were going to use for the
                    slot machine. We made the decision to use unicode characters, because even if some terminals dont support
                    them, they are way better for this job than plain ascii characters. We ended up using the symbols
                    of the 4 suits of french-suited playing cards to keep the gambling aesthetic, and the we chose to add 
                    the classic lucky 7 that for some reason has really been asociated with slot machines.
