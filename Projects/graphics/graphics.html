                    One of the coolest things you can do with a computer is to show
                    things on the screen. In the past I have used Unity, Godot, and
                    even SDL to do this kind of thing (to varying extents of success), 
                    but I have always wondered how does the process work at a lower level, 
                    so this summer I decided to finally start learning graphics programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing things on your screen is not a simple process, and it gets worse
                    due to the fact that not all gpus work exactly the same. To solve this,
                    some really smart people created the following system: The proggramer uses an 
                    API that specifies the behaviour of many functions,
                    but the functions themselves are not implemented. Then, the graphics card 
                    vendors actually implement these functions, which are part of your drivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that in order to draw anything, you have to use a graphics programming
                    API. Right now there are two main graphics APIs: OpenGL and Vulkan. Vulkan is kind
                    of the new industry standard due to being faster than OpenGL, but it works at a 
                    lower level, so its way harder. That's why I ended up choosing OpenGL, wich is 
                    a lot more begginer friendly, and you end up learning a lot about the rendering
                    pipeline anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in learning OpenGl, the best way possible is the OpenGL bible:
                    <a href="learnopengl.com">learnopengl</a>. It starts from the very begginnig and 
                    slowly builds upon itself until you are doing cool stuff. It's kind of hard in 
                    the beggining, and you will need linear algebra, but its really fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After setting everything up and linking every library (literal hell on windows), 
                    the first step was to create a window with a triangle. This is like the "hello 
                    world" of graphics programming, but unlike "hello world", "hello triangle" 
                    introduces a lot of concepts about how everything works, so you have to go 
                    through it many times until you get the idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I was introduced to vertex and fragment shaders, wich are gpu programs that 
                    run once for each vertex (the vertex shader) and each pixel (the fragment shader).
                    For example here I had a simple fragment shader that changed the color of two 
                    triangles using a sine function:
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img style="width: 50%;" src="triangle.gif">
                </div>

                <p>
                    After doing some more 2d stuff like using textures, it was time to actually do 
                    something in 3d. It is at this point that math begins to appear. 
                    In order to represent vertex coordinates in convenient ways, you have different 
                    coordinates systems, and you have to use different transformation matrixes to 
                    transform vertex coordinates from one space to another in order to have 
                    everything renderer properly. 
                </p>

                    This was my first 3d program, I was so happy :)

                    Then I rendered something more complex than a simple square, a cube! 
                    But something strange happened at first.
