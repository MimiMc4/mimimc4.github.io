                <p>Hey, this is the webmaster, mimi.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm a 19 years old programmer from spain who likes... 
                    well... a lot of things.
                    
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid I've always had a fascination with tech.
                    At the beggining, I was mainly interested in game development, but in
                    the end, game-deving was just the gateway to the world of computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now I'm studying computer science and it is as gratifying as it 
                    is exhausting, but I can save some time for side projects regardless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created this website mainly because I wanted to learn some basic html 
                    and css, but I will probably update this with my small coding adventures 
                    and wathever I want to share with the negative number of people who will 
                    visit this page.
                </p>
