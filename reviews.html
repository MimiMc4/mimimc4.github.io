                            I don't know why, but I love these kinds of stories in which the main
                            character begins to make new friends and they all have fun together, after
                            having been alone for a long time. They feel full of hope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also I really liked the gender bend dynamic. It was really cute seeing Mahiro
                            start feeling more and more confortable with her (his?) feminine side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over all it was a really enjoyable watch. You can feel the studio's passion
                            on each chapter (maybe too much booba tho).

                            The novel starts really strong. The premise makes you ask a ton of questions,
                            and the presentation is super mysterious, especially with that eye looking at you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has great ideas and some strong routes, but in the end some things felt
                            unresolved, and some scenes are just bad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Either way, it was a good read, and most of its flaws are just what you'd expect
                            from a first work.

                            Really short visual novel about an unemployed girl who gets a job
                            to buy an expensive anime figure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pretty short story but really charming. The visual presentation is
                            so cool (the art is literally made in MS Paint lol), and there were
                            some cool music tracks too.

                            I had a lot of fun reading this manga.
                            It's a slice of life story centered around otaku culture.
                            The character chemistry is great, I enjoyed
                            reading their back-and-forth conversations a lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I liked how it talks about accepting yourself and eachother.
                            I also really liked the way the series handles
                            romantic relationships, they feel so natural.
                        </p>

                            I know there's a second part to this manga,
                            but it's been a while since I was this sad about
                            finishing a story and leaving the characters behind...

                            Started watching on a whim because I tought
                            the character design was cute.
                            I was really surprised with the way it tells
                            it's story, specially the dream
                            scenes, they were so so good.

                            Unsetling, but the atmosphere grabs you and doesn't let
                            you look away.
                            I'll probably have to read it again to fully grasp it.
                            The backgrounds were great.
