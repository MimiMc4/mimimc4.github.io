                            What a bittersweet story.

                            It was full of many different kinds of love. And plenty of grief too.

                            A really interesting dive into what it takes to make manga.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this book Araki explains the different pillars that build his
                            manga and stories. He also talks about his experience in the industry,
                            and you can see cool things that happen behind the scenes.

                        <p>
                            The focus is shonen manga, but I think many ideas can be extrapolated
                            to other mediums and genres.

                            Probably one of the best things to ever come out of battle shonen manga. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tone is rowdy and irreverent but underneath there is a great degree of sensitivity 
                            and heart. The story is very blunt; people just die, and the survivors have to deal with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love how Fujimoto writes his characters. I loved Denji and how he looks for purpose and 
                            genuine human connections. Especially his relationship with Power was very sweet.

                            Kaguya-hime but with vtubers, idols and vr moba games. It does a solid job
                            at portraying modern otaku vtuber/idol culture.

                            While watching it at first I thought it was just a cute little movie, but the last hour was really good.
                            Kinda spoilery but I was surprised seeing yuri that doesn't barely hide behind subtext.

                            The animation was amazing, and I loved the in-game character designs.
                            It was nice hearing World is mine and Melt. Also, Beat Saber mentioned (3 seconds reference).

                            After Fire Punch, I wanted more from this man. This anthology of short

                            This story has left me speechless. The premise is incredibly original and totally insane.
                            Fujimoto just knows how to make the most of it, asking deep questions
                            along the way. The art is incredible as usual.

                            I wasn't expecting cinema to have such an important role in the story, but 
                            I really enjoyed its presence throughout. I loved Togata too.

                            Really short read, but really emotive.

                            I liked the contrast between the cruelty of the real world, and the almost 
                            romantic worldview of Yumemi, a remnant of a distant past. She is really endearing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It left me feeling that even in such a dark reality there is still room for
                            hope.

                            I don't know why, but I love these kinds of stories in which the main
                            character begins to make new friends and they all have fun together, after
                            having been alone for a long time. They feel full of hope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also I really liked the gender bend dynamic. It was really cute seeing Mahiro
                            start feeling more and more confortable with her (his?) feminine side.

                            Over all it was a really enjoyable watch. You can feel the studio's passion
                            on each chapter (maybe too much booba tho).

                            The novel starts really strong. The premise makes you ask a ton of questions,
                            and the presentation is super mysterious, especially with that eye looking at you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has great ideas and some strong routes, but in the end some things felt
                            unresolved, and some scenes are just bad.

                        <p>
                            Either way, it was a good read, and most of its flaws are just what you'd expect
                            from a debut work.

                            Really short visual novel about an unemployed girl who gets a job
                            to buy an expensive anime figure.

                            Pretty short story but really charming. The visual presentation is
                            so cool (the art is literally made in MS Paint lol), and there were
                            some cool music tracks too.

                            I had a lot of fun reading this manga.
                            It's a slice of life story centered around otaku culture.
                            The character chemistry is great, I enjoyed
                            reading their back-and-forth conversations a lot.

                        <p>
                            I liked how it talks about accepting yourself and eachother.
                            I also really liked the way the series handles
                            romantic relationships, they feel so natural.

                            I know there's a second part to this manga,
                            but it's been a while since I was this sad about
                            finishing a story and leaving the characters behind...
