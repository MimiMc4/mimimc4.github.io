                            I had a lot of fun reading this manga.
                            It's a slice of life story centered around otaku culture. 
                            The character chemistry is great, I enjoyed  
                            just reading their conversations a lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I liked how it talks about accepting yourself and eachother. 
                            I also really liked the way the series handles 
                            romantic relationships, they feel so natural.
                        </p>

                            I know there's a second part to this manga,
                            but it's been a while since I was this sad about
                            finishing a story and leaving the characters behind...

                            Started watching on a whim because I tought 
                            the character design was cute.
                            I was really surprised with the way it tells
                            it's story, specially the dream
                            scenes, they were so so good.

                            Kinda sad that the OVA doesn't adapt the full story, 
                            so I gess I'll read the manga.

                            Unsetling, but the atmosphere grabs you and doesn't let 
                            you look away. 
                            I'll probably have to read it again to fully grasp it.
                            The backgrounds were great.
                            Will be listening to some of the tracks.

                            The relationship between Rei and the Kawamoto family was super 
                            sweet.

                            Really cool to see the differences on style from these
                            giant directors. 
                            Noriko is great at aura farming.
                            Both of the endings were really special, glad I could 
                            experience this blind.
